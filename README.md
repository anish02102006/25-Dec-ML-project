# 25-Dec-ML-Project

## 📊 Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that predicts student academic performance using the **Student Performance Dataset** and a Python Jupyter Notebook.

The model helps explore patterns in student data and builds a predictor for academic outcomes using ML techniques.

---

## 🧾 Dataset

- **Student_Performance_Dataset.csv** — Dataset containing student academic records and features used for prediction.
- The dataset includes attributes such as study time, support received, attendance, etc., which can influence performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project:

- Loads and explores the student performance dataset.
- Preprocesses the data (cleaning and feature preparation).
- Trains one or more Machine Learning models.
- Evaluates the model performance using common metrics (accuracy, etc.).
- Shows how predictions vary with different features.

## 🛠️ Dependencies & Setup

To run the notebook locally, you should have **Python 3.x** and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
````

Alternatively, you can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(*You can create this file yourself if you want to include dependency versions.*)
